**Notes:**

1> We can skip triggering of Actions workflow by commiting with **[skip ci]** keyword.

2> Ensure cron pipeline workflow file is disabled once the testing is done. Otherwise it runs everytime depending on the time schedule provided.

3> We can also trigger workflow based on conditions like run this job only there is pull request and run this job only if there is push to master branch etc..
